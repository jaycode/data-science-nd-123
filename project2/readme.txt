Information:
I picked Bali as my choice of area for project 2 as it is the most internationally well known area in my country, hence the reviewer may be able to relate in a way or another with my report.
In this report we will see:
1. The completeness and correctness of uploaded data.
2. Some interesting insights like most popular tourist attractions and natural landmarks.
3. Suggestions for data validation and tourist map using the data we gathered in this project.

Scripts and results of running them can be found in directory "final_project_scripts" and "Project2Appendixes.pdf".
